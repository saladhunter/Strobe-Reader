## About This Repository

This was the original Swift-based macOS application for speed reading. While fully functional, the project has transitioned to a web-based approach for better accessibility and broader audience reach.

### If You Want to Use the macOS Version

The app still works perfectly on macOS! To build it:

```bash
xcodebuild -project Speedreader.xcodeproj -scheme Speedreader -configuration Debug
```

Then find the app in `build/Build/Products/Debug/Speedreader.app`

### Why We Moved to Web

- **Accessibility**: Web version works on any device (Windows, Mac, Linux, mobile)
- **No barriers**: Just open a URL, no installation needed
- **Community**: Much larger contributor base for web technologies
- **Maintenance**: Easier to deploy updates instantly
